# 🧙‍♂️ SigilVault — Eternum’s Terminal of Truth

> **SigilVault** is a Swift-based CLI Wallet + Sigil Sealing Engine for Eternum.
> It protects logic, verifies cryptographic signatures, and manifests intentionality on-chain and off.

## 🌐 What It Does

- ✅ Creates Ethereum-compatible wallets
- 🧿 Canonically signs JSON data ("sigils") with private keys
- 🔐 Seals them into immutable proofs using `CryptoKit` + `Bundle.module`
- 📁 All local. No Metamask. No web exposure.
- ♾️ Verified using CLI hash checks, canonical `jq` formatting, and human-readable spellbook logs

## ✨ Why It Matters

Eternum is building a quantum-aligned blockchain ecosystem. The SigilVault is its anchor — allowing developers, agents, and protocols to cast logic-bound intent with audit-ready immutability.

This isn’t just code.
It’s **ritualized cryptographic authorship**.

> “May every sigil sealed become a truth bound to time.”
