# SigilVault 🧿 - Eternum’s Terminal of Truth

A local-first, Swift-based CLI wallet and sigil sealing engine for Web3.

---

## The Problem: The Crisis of Trust in Wallets

The current Web3 wallet experience creates anxiety. Onboarding is intimidating, transactions are opaque, and security is often a browser-based afterthought. We are asking users to become sovereign, but giving them tools that inspire doubt.

## The Solution: SigilVault 🔐

SigilVault is a command-line interface (CLI) that solves these problems by returning power, clarity, and truth to the user. It is built for sovereignty.

* **✅ Local-First Security:** Creates and manages Ethereum-compatible wallets entirely on your machine. No web exposure. No Metamask. Your keys remain verifiably yours.

* **🧿 Intentional Signing:** Canonically signs human-readable JSON data ("sigils") with your private key. You sign clear intentions, not confusing hexadecimal strings.

* **📁 Immutable Proofs:** Seals your signed sigils into immutable cryptographic proofs using Apple's robust CryptoKit framework, creating a verifiable audit trail.

* **♾️ Verifiable Truth:** All operations are transparently verified through command-line hash checks and human-readable "spellbook" logs.

## The Vision: Beyond a Wallet

SigilVault is a core component of **Eternum**, a regenerative intelligence protocol. It is the tool that allows users to interact with the ecosystem with absolute confidence, ensuring every action is intentional, sovereign, and true.
